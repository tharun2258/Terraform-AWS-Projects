Terraform EC2 Instance Setup Guide
This guide outlines the steps to create an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform. It covers the necessary configuration files and resources required to provision the EC2 instance along with its network and security setup.

Steps to Create an EC2 Instance:
Create the provider.tf File:

Define the cloud provider details, such as AWS region and credentials, in the provider.tf file. This file allows Terraform to authenticate and interact with your cloud provider.
Create the main.tf File:

In this file, define the AWS resources such as the EC2 instance, VPC, subnet, security group, and other required components. This file will contain the main configuration for your infrastructure.

Key Pair Resource: Initially, create a key pair resource to enable secure SSH access to your EC2 instance.

VPC and Networking:

Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), a subnet, and an internet gateway.
Set up a route table and associate it with the subnet to ensure your EC2 instance has internet access.
Security Group:

Create a security group with inbound and outbound rules to control traffic to and from the EC2 instance.
EC2 Instance Resource:

Define the EC2 instance resource, linking it with the key pair, subnet, security group, and other resources youâ€™ve created.
Create the variables.tf File:

Define variables in the variables.tf file to avoid hardcoding values in main.tf. This improves readability and maintainability, and makes it easier to reuse the configuration in different environments.
Create the output.tf File:

Define output values in the output.tf file to display important information about the resources created, such as the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
